# Standard Operating Procedure: Video Transcription & Summarization Workflow

## 1. Purpose
This SOP defines the end-to-end workflow for accepting video assets, generating transcripts, producing summaries, and delivering outputs to stakeholders. It ensures consistent quality, predictable turnaround times, and clear accountability as the platform evolves.

## 2. Scope
- Applies to all environments (local development, staging, production) used to process customer video content.
- Covers manual and automated execution of the workflow, along with exception handling and quality checks.
- Excludes product feature prioritization, model research spikes, or vendor contract negotiations.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Product Owner (PO):** Prioritizes intake requests, defines acceptance criteria, and signs off on release readiness.
- **Operations Lead:** Oversees daily processing queue, assigns operators, and approves reruns.
- **Transcription Operator:** Runs ingestion, monitors transcription jobs, and completes transcript QA.
- **Summarization Operator:** Tunes summary prompts/templates, validates outputs, and packages deliverables.
- **Platform Engineer:** Maintains infrastructure, resolves system incidents, and manages deployments.

## 4. Definitions
- **Raw Video Asset:** Original media file uploaded by customers or ingested from external sources.
- **Processing Job:** A unit of work that encapsulates transcription and summarization tasks for a single asset.
- **Confidence Score:** Numeric indicator returned by the speech-to-text engine showing transcript reliability.
- **Delivery Package:** Bundle of final artifacts (transcript, summaries, metadata) made available to consumers.

## 5. Prerequisites
- Valid credentials for storage, speech-to-text provider, and summarization LLM endpoints.
- Approved version of the platform infrastructure deployed and smoke-tested.
- Current prompt templates and summary formats stored under `docs/prompts/` (create if absent).
- Access to monitoring dashboards and alerting channels (Slack `#transcription-ops`).
- Knowledge base links for vendor-specific quotas, rate limits, and maintenance windows.

## 6. Standard Workflow
1. **Intake & Triage**
   - Receive request via intake form or API.
   - Confirm media format, duration, language, and required turnaround.
   - Create or update a processing job record in the work tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear), tagging `transcription` and `summary` components.
2. **Asset Staging**
   - Upload or sync video to object storage bucket following naming convention: `videos/{yyyy}/{mm}/{request-id}/source.ext`.
   - Generate a checksum and log it in the job record.
   - Trigger antivirus/media validation if enabled. Quarantine and escalate on failure.
3. **Transcription Execution**
   - Submit audio to the configured speech-to-text engine with language and diarization options.
   - Monitor queue length and job status via dashboard; investigate any job exceeding SLA thresholds.
   - On completion, store transcript as Markdown or JSON under `data/transcripts/{request-id}.json` with metadata (timestamps, speaker tags, confidence scores).
4. **Transcript Quality Assurance**
   - Review flagged segments (confidence score < 0.85) and correct misheard phrases using source audio.
   - Validate speaker labeling, punctuation, and formatting.
   - Record QA results in the job record, noting any sections requiring follow-up.
5. **Summarization Execution**
   - Select summary templates (executive summary, bullet highlights, action items) based on request.
   - Run summarization service with transcript input; capture model parameters and prompt version in logs.
   - Store outputs under `data/summaries/{request-id}/` with clear filenames (`executive.md`, `bullets.md`, etc.).
6. **Summary Quality Assurance**
   - Verify factual consistency against transcript; ensure no hallucinated names, dates, or figures.
   - Check tone and length meet acceptance criteria; adjust prompt or regenerate if needed.
   - Confirm redaction of sensitive data where required.
7. **Delivery & Handoff**
   - Compile delivery package (transcript, summaries, metadata report).
   - Notify stakeholders through the agreed channel (email, Slack, API callback) and attach delivery link.
   - Update job record to "Complete" with timestamps, processing duration, and final storage location.

## 7. Exception Handling
- **Transcription Failure:** Retry once with alternate engine parameters; escalate to Platform Engineer if second attempt fails.
- **Low Confidence Transcript:** Flag to Operations Lead; perform manual review or request customer clarification.
- **Summarization Drift:** Roll back to last known good prompt template and open a ticket for prompt tuning.
- **Storage Outage:** Pause new ingests, switch to secondary bucket if available, and follow incident protocol (Section 9).

## 8. Automation & Tooling Guidelines
- Maintain IaC definitions (e.g., Terraform) for storage buckets, queues, and compute resources.
- Version control prompt templates and summarization configurations alongside application code.
- Configure CI to run smoke tests for transcription and summarization services before deployment.
- Implement alerts for queue backlog, API error rates, and cost anomalies.

## 9. Incident Management
- Declare an incident if SLAs are at risk for more than 30 minutes or critical functionality is down.
- Platform Engineer initiates incident bridge and posts updates every 30 minutes.
- Record timeline, root cause, and remediation actions in the incident report template under `docs/incidents/`.
- After resolution, conduct a blameless postmortem and log follow-up tasks.

## 10. Change Management
- Proposals for workflow changes must include impact analysis, rollout plan, and rollback steps.
- Obtain sign-off from Product Owner and Platform Engineer prior to production changes.
- Update this SOP, related runbooks, and onboard training materials when changes ship.
- Communicate upcoming changes to operators at least 48 hours in advance.

## 11. Metrics & Continual Improvement
- Track turnaround time, transcript accuracy, summary satisfaction score, and incident rate.
- Review metrics in monthly ops retrospective; identify automation or training opportunities.
- Pilot improvements in staging before production adoption and document learnings.

## 12. Document Control
- **Owner:** Operations Lead
- **Review Cadence:** Quarterly or after major workflow update (whichever comes first)
- **Revision History:**
