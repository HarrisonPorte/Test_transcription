# Delivery Roadmap & Work Map

## 1. Purpose
This document maps the major bodies of work required to take the Test_transcription platform from concept to production. It inventories the documents, code modules, infrastructure components, and operational artifacts that should be created, and groups the work into sequenced phases to guide execution.

## 2. High-Level Phases
1. **Foundations & Alignment** – Establish vision, requirements, and architectural guardrails.
2. **Transcription Pipeline** – Build ingestion, storage, and speech-to-text workflow.
3. **Summarization & Enrichment** – Layer summarization, prompt management, and QA automation.
4. **Delivery Channels** – Expose outputs through APIs, UI, and integrations.
5. **Operations & Scale** – Harden monitoring, security, cost controls, and incident response.

Each phase has mandatory documents, code changes, and operational runbooks outlined below.

## 3. Phase 1: Foundations & Alignment
**Documents to Create**
- `docs/product-brief.md` – Personas, user stories, success metrics, non-functional requirements.
- `docs/domain-model.md` – Entities (`Video`, `Transcript`, `Summary`, `Job`), relationships, lifecycle state diagram.
- `docs/architecture-overview.md` – Context diagram, deployment topology, data flow, integration points.
- `docs/adr/0001-tech-stack.md` – Decision log for chosen frameworks, speech-to-text provider, summarization stack.

**Repository Structure to Introduce**
```
backend/
  app/
  tests/
infra/
  terraform/
services/
  transcription/
  summarization/
docs/adr/
```

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- `infra/terraform/storage.tf` – Object storage bucket definition.
- `infra/terraform/queue.tf` – Job queue (SQS, Pub/Sub, etc.).
- `docker-compose.yml` – Local stack (API + worker + mock speech-to-text).

## 5. Phase 3: Summarization & Enrichment
**Documents**
- `docs/summarization/prompt-catalog.md` – Library of prompts/templates with versioning.
- `docs/summarization/quality-checklist.md` – Criteria for human review and automated validation.
- `docs/evaluation/summary-benchmarking.md` – Evaluation methodology, metrics, datasets.

**Code & Files**
- `services/summarization/generator.py` – Interface to LLM/summary engine.
- `services/summarization/templates/` – Markdown/JSON prompt assets.
- `backend/app/routes/summaries.py` – Endpoints to request summaries and fetch results.
- `backend/tests/test_summary_generation.py` – Unit tests covering prompt rendering and output validation.
- `scripts/evaluate_summaries.py` – Batch evaluation harness for regression testing models.

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- `infra/terraform/secrets.tf` – Secrets management integrations (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
- `infra/terraform/worker.tf` – Compute resources for summarization workers.
- `monitoring/prometheus.yml` – Metrics collection starter config.

## 6. Phase 4: Delivery Channels
**Documents**
- `docs/api/openapi.yaml` – Formal API specification.
- `docs/ui/wireframes.md` – UI mockups/light design specs (if web portal is pursued).
- `docs/integrations/webhook-guide.md` – Webhook contract, retry semantics, security guidance.

**Code & Files**
- `frontend/` folder (if building a web UI) with initial scaffolding (React/Vue/etc.).
- `backend/app/routes/webhooks.py` – Callback receiver for customer notifications.
- `backend/app/routes/exports.py` – Endpoint to download packaged deliverables.
- `backend/tests/test_api_contracts.py` – Contract tests ensuring API spec alignment.
- `integration-tests/` suite to validate end-to-end flows across services.

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- `infra/cdn/` configs for serving downloadable assets.
- `infra/terraform/api-gateway.tf` – Public API gateway/proxy definition.
- `ci/github-actions/api-contract.yml` – CI workflow running API compliance checks.

## 7. Phase 5: Operations & Scale
**Documents**
- `docs/operations/runbooks/incident-response.md` – Detailed incident escalation and comms plan.
- `docs/security/threat-model.md` – Security review, data classification, mitigation plans.
- `docs/cost-management/reporting.md` – Budget monitoring strategy and cost guardrails.
- `docs/compliance/data-retention-policy.md` – Data lifecycle rules and deletion processes.

**Code & Files**
- `monitoring/alerts/` – Alert definitions and thresholds.
- `scripts/cost_reports.py` – Automated cost reporting job (optional but recommended).
- `terraform/modules/` – Reusable modules for multi-environment deployment.
- `Makefile` – Standardized developer workflows (setup, lint, test, deploy).

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- `infra/terraform/logging.tf` – Centralized logging.
- `infra/terraform/iam.tf` – Least-privilege access policies.
- `ci/github-actions/ops.yml` – Nightly smoke tests, cost guardrails, backup verification.

## 8. Cross-Cutting Tracks
- **Testing & QA:** Establish `tests/`, `integration-tests/`, and `load-tests/` directories early; adopt pytest (or equivalent) with coverage thresholds.
- **DevEx:** Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and update `README.md` with setup instructions as tooling solidifies.
- **Data Governance:** Create `docs/data-classification.md` and `docs/pii-handling.md` to govern sensitive information.
- **Analytics:** Introduce `analytics/` directory for usage tracking schemas and BI dashboards when customer analytics becomes a priority.

## 9. Tracking & Governance
- Maintain roadmap status inside `docs/delivery-roadmap.md` with checkboxes per artifact.
- Convert each major deliverable into tickets within the issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Projects).
- Update SOP (`docs/SOP.md`) whenever operational steps change.
- Review roadmap quarterly during ops retrospectives; adjust scope and priorities as needed.

## 10. Immediate Next Actions (Suggested Order)
1. Draft `docs/product-brief.md` and `docs/domain-model.md` to anchor shared understanding.
2. Set up repository scaffolding (`backend/`, `services/`, `infra/`) with placeholder README files.
3. Produce ADRs documenting initial technology selections.
4. Implement transcription ingestion MVP with mocked provider and persistence layer.
5. Build summarization service skeleton with template management.
6. Publish API specification (`docs/api/openapi.yaml`) and align backend routes.
7. Harden operations: monitoring configs, incident runbooks, and security policies.
