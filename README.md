# Test_transcription

## Overview
Test_transcription is an emerging platform that ingests video content, generates accurate transcripts, and produces concise summaries tailored to different audiences. The project is currently in the planning and documentation phase, defining the workflows, architecture, and operational practices before implementation begins.

## Key Documents
- [Standard Operating Procedure](SOP.md) – Day-to-day operational workflow for transcription and summarization.
- [Delivery Roadmap](delivery-roadmap.md) – Phase-by-phase plan mapping every document, code module, and infrastructure component.
- [Tree Map](tree-map.md) – Hierarchical view of the planned repository structure and supporting artifacts.

As additional guides come online (e.g., product brief, ADRs, runbooks), they will live alongside this README in the `docs/` directory.

## Current Status
- Documentation groundwork is in place; no production code has been committed yet.
- Repository structure and required assets are outlined in `tree-map.md` and sequenced in `delivery-roadmap.md`.
- Operational expectations for early pilots are captured in `SOP.md`.

## Getting Started
1. Review the roadmap to understand the phased delivery plan and outstanding artifacts.
2. Use the tree map as a blueprint when creating new directories or files.
3. Align process decisions with the SOP, updating it as workflows evolve.
4. Draft the next-layer documents (product brief, domain model, architecture overview) to unlock implementation work.

## Next Steps for Contributors
- Track progress by checking off items within `delivery-roadmap.md` and updating the tree map when new assets are added.
- Once foundational documents are signed off, begin scaffolding the backend/services directories described in the tree map.
- Introduce tooling (virtual environments, linting, CI) early so the codebase remains consistent as the team grows.
