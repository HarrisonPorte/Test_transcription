 # Test_transcription
-This document is here for videos to be uploaded, transcribed, then a summary would come out of it in different formats and forms.
+
+## Project Vision
+Test_transcription aims to provide an end-to-end workflow for uploading video content, automatically generating high-quality transcripts, and delivering concise summaries in multiple formats. The long-term goal is to give content creators and knowledge workers an easy way to extract insights from audiovisual material without manual effort.
+
+## Current Repository Layout
+The repository is currently a blank slate that contains only this README. No source code, configuration files, or infrastructure scripts have been added yet. Treat the project as a greenfield effort where you can help shape the initial architecture and conventions.
+
+```

+└── README.md  # Project overview and onboarding guide
+```
+
+## Planned Workflow
+1. **Video ingestion:** Accept uploads from users or ingest files from external sources.
+2. **Automatic transcription:** Convert audio tracks into text using a speech-to-text engine.
+3. **Summarization:** Produce human-friendly summaries (plain text, bullet points, key takeaways, etc.).
+4. **Delivery:** Surface the transcript and summaries via an API, UI, or export mechanism.
+
+## Architectural Building Blocks
+- **Backend/API layer:** Handles authentication, video uploads, job orchestration, and exposes transcript/summary endpoints.
+- **Transcription service:** Interfaces with a speech-to-text engine (e.g., Whisper, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) and stores raw transcripts.
+- **Summarization service:** Applies NLP models or LLMs to generate multiple summary formats from transcripts.
+- **Data storage:** Persists uploaded media, transcript text, metadata, and generated summaries.
+- **Background processing:** Manages long-running transcription/summarization tasks, likely through a worker queue.
+
+## Technology Considerations
+| Concern | Options to Explore |
+| --- | --- |
+| **Web framework / API** | FastAPI, Django REST Framework, Flask |
+| **Task queue** | Celery, RQ, Dramatiq, serverless workflows |
+| **Speech-to-text** | OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe |
+| **Summarization / NLP** | OpenAI GPT models, Hugging Face transformers, spaCy pipelines |
+| **Storage** | Object storage (S3, GCS), relational DB (PostgreSQL), vector store for embeddings |
+| **Infrastructure** | Docker containers, Kubernetes, serverless functions depending on scale |
+
+## Tooling & Quality Gates
+- Adopt a dependency manager (`pyproject.toml` with Poetry or `requirements.txt` with pip) to standardize environments.
+- Configure linting and formatting (e.g., `ruff`, `black`, `isort`) alongside pre-commit hooks.
+- Set up automated tests (unit + integration) and wire them to CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
+- Document environment variables, secrets management, and deployment workflows.
+
+## Getting Started for New Contributors
+1. **Define user personas and detailed requirements.** Capture who will upload content and how summaries are consumed.
+2. **Sketch the domain model and API contracts.** Identify entities such as `Video`, `Transcript`, `Summary`, and the endpoints/jobs that connect them.
+3. **Establish the directory structure.** Create `backend/`, `services/`, `docs/`, or other folders that match the planned architecture.
+4. **Prototype the upload-to-transcript path.** A simple CLI or script that ingests a file and calls a transcription API is a good first milestone.
+5. **Experiment with summarization techniques.** Compare extractive vs. abstractive methods and capture findings in docs.
+6. **Implement observability early.** Decide how to collect logs, metrics, and traces to monitor long-running jobs.
+
+## Additional Resources to Explore
+- Speech-to-text benchmarking articles to compare accuracy and cost trade-offs.
+- Tutorials on orchestrating background workers and cloud storage for large media files.
+- Guides on prompt engineering and evaluation frameworks for LLM-based summarization.
+
+By iterating on these foundations, contributors can build a robust platform that turns raw video into actionable insights.
